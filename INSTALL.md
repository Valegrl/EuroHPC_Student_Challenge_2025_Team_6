# Installation Guide
This file explains the installation and setup process.

&nbsp;
## Prerequisites
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- **CMake** (≥ 3.10)
- **MPI** (e.g., OpenMPI or MPICH)
- **GCC/G++** (≥ C++17)
- **OpenMP**
- **Python**

On Vega supercomputer, load the following:

```sh
module load openmpi/4.1.2.1
```

&nbsp;
## Compilation
Navigate to the project root and run:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This generates the executable `solver` in `build/bin/`.

&nbsp;
## Running the Solver
To execute the solver manually:

```sh
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<num_threads>
mpirun -np <num_processes> ./bin/solver <input_file> <time_limit_sec>
```

Example:

```sh
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=256
mpirun -np 4 ./bin/solver ../instances/anna.col 500
```

&nbsp;
## I) Running Benchmarks

To automate the execution across multiple input files and process configurations, use:

```sh
sbatch run_benchmarks.sh
```

This script:

1. Iterates through `instances/`
2. Runs `solver` with varying MPI process counts (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64)
3. Saves results in `build/output`


&nbsp;
## II) Running analysis

To automate the analysis across multiple input files and process configurations, use:

```sh
python3 run_scripts.py
```

This script:

1. Converts `.output` files from `build/output` to  `.txt` files in `build/output/outTxt`
2. Reads the generated `.txt` files and plots the graphs in `build/plots`
3. Generates a summary table in `build/configuration_table_sorted.csv`
